<h1>Strain Keeper -</h1>

A web application developed with multiple purposes in-mind. The first, to provide a tool in which cannabis users can record and reference the different strains they have tried. The second, using information in its database, Strain Keeper can connect different effects to the different cannabis strains. This information would provide greater insights about strain effects for the cannabis industry. Developed using the MEAN stack with Bootstrap and jQuery on the front-end.
