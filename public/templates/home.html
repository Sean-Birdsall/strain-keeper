      different cannabis strains that you have tried and how you feel about each
      strain.

      <p class="mission">
        We believe that the different cannabis strains can make this world a better
        place if we understand how their effects help or hinder users. To better understand
        these effects we are taking input from the people who have tried them, our users,
        and recording our results for the world to see. Hopefully the information we gather
        will help to further cannabis education and research in the world.
